##  About <a name = "about"></a>

PerfectBrew is a simple vanilla JavaScript application that connects to BrewDog's PunkAPI which allows users to search for their favorite foods to find beers that pair well with them. 

Upon a completed search, the application will display all matching beers in a card format with a picture of the beer, tagline, description, ABV(alcohol by volume) and IBU(international bitterness units). 

The goal of this application is to get more practice manipulating the DOM with JavaScript and taking advantage of JavaScript's promise based FetchAPI for making asynchronous HTTP requests from the browser. 

## Built Using  
  * HTML5
  * CSS3/SCSS
  * JavaScript (ES6)
  * Webpack
  * [BrewDog PunkAPI](https://punkapi.com/)
